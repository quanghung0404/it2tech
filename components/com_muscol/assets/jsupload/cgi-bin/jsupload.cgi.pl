############################################################################################
## * * The provided server script has been written in perl for the GWTUpload/JSUpload library.
## *
## * * This script requires perl, CGI and Digest::MD5, which are installed by default in
## * most linux/unix distributions.
## *
## * * You have to put this file in a script/cgi-bin enabled folder of your web server, and
## * you have to set the rigth execution permissions.
## *
## * # *Operation*:
## *    * When it receives a POST request, it updates periodically a status file with the progress, 
## *      and stores all received form elements in a temporary folder for the user session.
## *    * When it receives GET requests, returns a xml response with the progess information.
## *    * When the GET request, has the parameter show=xxxx, it returns the content of the form
## *      element whose name is xxxx. If the element is a file it sends a response with the adequate
## *      content-type, otherwise it returns a xml response with the element's value.
## * # *Configuration*: At the top of the script you have some customizable variables.
## *   * $idname: is the name for the sessionid cookie name, you could redefine it to match
## *              the name of the cookie set by your application. By default the name is CGISESSID.
## *   * $tmp_dir: is the prefix used in the path location to store the data received. By default
## *              it is set to "/tmp/uploader", normally you have to change it to match the path
## *              configured in your application. It is strongly recommended that this directory 
## *              should be created apart from "/tmp", in a non-httpd accessible path.
## *   * $max_size: is the maximum size in bytes allowed for the entire request size, note that it is not
## *              the real file size because the request includes the headers and could have more
## *              files or parameters. Normally only one file is transfered, and the request size
## *              is very closed to the file size.
## *   * $mkpath: if true jsupload will create the folder to store the received data, otherwise
## *              it is the application the responsible of creating it. Note that setting it to false 
## *              your system is protected to be used as a surreptitious storage area. The files 
## *              in this folder will be created with the default perl permissions (0666 or the user umask), 
## *              so in the case you leave the application to create the folder be aware to set the
## *              appropriate permissions.
## *   * $slow:   if it has a value greater than zero, after each chunk received, jsupload will sleep
## *              for this value in seconds (it may be fractional). It is used to see the progress bar 
## *              in fast networks when you are testing or developing your app.
## * # *Integration*:
## *   * The files are stored in the folder $tmp_dir/xxxx where xxxx is the session id (cookie CGISESSID).
## *   * For each form element received, it stores a file /tmp/uploader/xxxx/yyyy.info 
## *     where yyyy is the name of the element.
## *   * In the case of file elements, it puts the content of the file in the file
## *     /tmp/uploader/xxxx/yyyy.bin.
## *   * The application must create, handle, and clean $tmp_dir files.
